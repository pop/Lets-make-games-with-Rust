# Let's make games with Rust

The Code companion for a talk I gave at SeaGL 2020 and a blog-post I wrote to accompany that talk.

## How to use this repo

The project is meant to act as a _very_ simple introduction to the [Amethyst Game Engine](https://amethyst.rs).

Follow the blog-post here: LINK COMING SOON

Each step in the blog-post has an accompanied tag:

- [Step 0: Join the Cargo Cult](https://github.com/pop/lets-make-games-with-rust/tree/step-0)
- [Step 1: Draw a Window](https://github.com/pop/lets-make-games-with-rust/tree/step-1)
- [Step 2: Draw a SeaGL](https://github.com/pop/lets-make-games-with-rust/tree/step-2)
- [Step 3: Move Around](https://github.com/pop/lets-make-games-with-rust/tree/step-3)
- [Step 4: Eat some Food](https://github.com/pop/lets-make-games-with-rust/tree/step-4)

Each tag can be checked out and run with `cargo run`.
